Sometimes on CPU a threading error occurs. This is, when the training hangs at random points. 
This can be resolved by setting threading environment variables with thread_env.sh. In that 
case, before executing main.py, enter in the command line:
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
$ export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
